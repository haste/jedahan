SUMMARY="Screenshots for the framebuffer"
DESCRIPTION="Fbshot is a small program that allowes you to take screenshots from your Linux framebuffer. This utility was written on x86 hardware (typical PC), therefore it has no support for other architectures and their framebuffers, especially not for Amiga nor Atari. On the other hand it should work on machines like Alpha's and maybe SUN's. I'm not sure. Anyways it supports following bit-depths: 8, 15, 16, 24 and 32. So it should be enought for everyone:)"
