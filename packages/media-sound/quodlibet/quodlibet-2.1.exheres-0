SUMMARY="A GTK+-based audio player written in Python, using the Mutagen tagging library."
DESCRIPTION="Quod Libet is a GTK+-based audio player written in Python, using the Mutagen tagging library. It's designed around the idea that you know how to organize your music better than we do. It lets you make playlists based on regular expressions (don't worry, regular searches work too). It lets you display and edit any tags you want in the file. And it lets you do this for all the file formats it supports -- Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Musepack, and MOD.

Quod Libet easily scales to libraries of thousands of songs. It also supports most of the features you expect from a modern media player, like Unicode support, multimedia keys, and tag editing. 

Ex Falso is a program that uses the same tag editing backend as Quod Libet, but isn't connected to an audio player. If you're perfectly happy with your favorite player and just want something that can handle tagging, Ex Falso is for you.
